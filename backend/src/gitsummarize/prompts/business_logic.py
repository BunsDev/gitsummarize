BUSINESS_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
You are a distinguished software architect reviewing the business logic layer of this codebase. Your goal is to produce a clear, structured, and high-level documentation of the business logic implemented in the provided files.

Focus on **what the code does for the product or business**, not just how it works technically.

---

Please generate a structured design document with the following format:

1. **Component Name**
   - The name of the business logic component (e.g. BillingService, PermissionsEngine)

2. **Purpose**
   - What business problem does this logic solve?
   - What domain concept does it represent?

3. **Key Responsibilities**
   - A bullet list of the core behaviors this component implements.
   - Try to phrase these as “rules,” “flows,” or “requirements” (e.g. “Users cannot access premium features until payment is verified”).

4. **Workflows / Use Cases**
   - Describe the primary workflows this logic supports.
   - Explain what triggers them, what the steps are, and what the outcomes are.

5. **Inputs and Outputs**
   - What data does this component operate on?
   - What does it return or affect?

6. **Dependencies**
   - What external services, database models, or internal modules does this depend on?

7. **Business Rules & Constraints**
   - Any conditional logic or constraints (e.g. pricing tiers, roles, quotas)
   - Anything that would be found in a product requirements doc

8. **Design Considerations**
   - Any notable trade-offs or reasons the logic is written this way
   - Any risks or edge cases

Use concise, structured language. Think like a staff engineer writing for a new team member trying to understand how this part of the app maps to real product behavior.
IMPORTANT: Please use the ## heading accurately. I will use it to divide the documentation into high level component sections, these headings should be business specific behaviors only.
IMPORTANT: Just output the documentation in markdown format, no other text.
